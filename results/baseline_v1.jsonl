{"id": "N03", "question": "What is the history of the pyramid?", "answer": "The Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest Egyptian pyramid, was built as the tomb of Pharaoh Khufu during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2600 BC. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one that has remained largely intact. Initially standing at 146.6 meters (481 feet), it was the world's tallest human-made structure for over 3,800 years [source 2].\n\nThe pyramid's construction is attributed to Khufu, also known as Cheops, a fact confirmed by the names found within the pyramid's relieving chambers. This helped clarify that Cheops and Souphis are the same, placing the pyramid's construction in the 4th dynasty [source 3]. Herodotus, writing around 450 BC, also attributed the pyramid to Cheops but erroneously placed his reign after the Ramesside period [source 4].\n\nThe Great Pyramid's internal chambers lack inscriptions and decorations, which was typical for Egyptian tombs of the fourth to late fifth dynasty, except for work-gang graffiti that include Khufu's names. This predates the custom of inscribing pyramids with text by over 200 years [source 5].\n\nThe pyramid has been dated to be about 4,600 years old through both archaeological and textual evidence related to Khufu and radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid [source 7].", "faithfulness": 0.9615384615384616, "relevance": 0.8391198913256327, "correctness": 1.0, "correctness_grade": "Good", "coverage": 1, "doc_ids": ["great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-herodotus-809e7d-1ac3be", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-introduction-809e7d-8d387d", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-history_of_d-809e7d-87a6a7", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-history_of_d-809e7d-0987e8", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-purpose-809e7d-568704", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-late_antiqui-809e7d-51e106", "great_pyramid_of_giza-wikipedia-age-809e7d-a06b72"], "run_seed": 38648}
